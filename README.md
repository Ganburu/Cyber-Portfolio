Active Directory Project (Home Lab)
In this project, I will show the steps of setting up an Active Directory (home lab) that includes Splunk, Kali Linux & Atomic Red Team. Explore how a domain environment works, learn how to ingest events to a SIEM and generate telemetry related to attacks seen in the wild. 

Here is a diagram of the network setup from app.diagrams.net that I made.
