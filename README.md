On September 30, 2016, at the Wayne Enterprises' Security Operations Center(SOC), A memo from Gotham City Police Department (GCPD). Apparently GCPD has found evidence online (http://pastebin.com/Gw6dWjS9) that the website www.imreallynotbatman.com hosted on Wayne Enterprises' IP address space has been compromised. The group has multiple objectives... but a key aspect of their modus operandi is to deface websites in order to embarrass their victim. Lucius,the SOC lead, asked Vaughn to determine if www.imreallynotbatman.com. (the personal blog of Wayne Corporations CEO) was really compromised. (NOT finished)
